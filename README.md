# EPICS DOCKER SETUP

Aim of this project: to create a simple docker image for learning purposes. At the moment it's not intended to be used for any projects, but feel free to use it as a base/reference material.

You can also use the python file to install EPICS modules.

## Quick Install

Since this project is mostly for learning purposes, it's not (yet) available on DockerHub.
All you need to do is install docker and build an image, then run it.

To build an image with everything:

```shell
docker build -t epics-base
```

Or to stop at a certain stage:

```shell
docker build -t epics-base --target < stage >
```

To run the Docker image, use the following line:

```shell
docker run -t -i epics-test
```

This will keep the container running and make the current shell an interactive ioc. You should see something like:

```shell
#!../../bin/linux-x86_64/exampleIoc
< envPaths
epicsEnvSet("IOC","iocexampleIoc")
epicsEnvSet("TOP","/EPICS/example/exampleIoc")
epicsEnvSet("MODULES","/EPICS/support")
epicsEnvSet("AUTOSAVE","/EPICS/support/autosave-R5-11")
epicsEnvSet("MOTOR","/EPICS/support/motor-R7-3-1")
epicsEnvSet("EPICS_BASE","/EPICS/epics-base")
cd "/EPICS/example/exampleIoc"
## Register all support components
dbLoadDatabase "dbd/exampleIoc.dbd"
exampleIoc_registerRecordDeviceDriver pdbbase
# epicsEnvSet ("STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH", "/ioc")
## Load record instances
dbLoadRecords("db/example.db","P=user, M=:axis1, user=user")
iocInit()

You can also use the python file by itself on ubuntu systems. It can install several modules quite easily:

```shell
python3 module_installer < /path/to/support/dir >  < path/to/modules.yml/or/empty >
```

Read the comments in the python file for more details.
