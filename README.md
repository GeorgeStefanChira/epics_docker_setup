## Quick Install

Since this project is mostly for learning purposes, it's not (yet) available on DockerHub.
All you need to do is install docker and build an image, then run it.

To build the image:

```shell
docker 
```

To run the Docker image without stopping the terminal (-d for background)

```shell
docker run -t -d epics-test
```
